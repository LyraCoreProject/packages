//! A Package's personality as a Runtime Script: edit, reconcile, and the bots decide differently.
//!
//! This is the rung nothing below it reaches. The answer rule is pure and tested where it lives
//! (`packages/playerbots/src/goals.rs::threshold_from`), and the shipped Lua is run against the
//! real Host by that Package's own tests. What only a live Shard can show is the whole loop: a
//! Script Artifact applied by a reducer, read back by the Event Binding dispatch, answered inside
//! the Runtime Script Host, and reaching a bot's decision on the next brain tick — with no
//! republish anywhere in it.
//!
//! Every case here is the same bot at full health with nothing to fight. On its personality row it
//! has no reason to break off; a script that answers "flee at 100%" gives it one. So the goal row
//! reading FLEE is the script deciding, and the goal row leaving FLEE is the fallback deciding.
